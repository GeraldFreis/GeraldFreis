Hello, I am Gerald Freislich a former Research Assistant and student at the University of Adelaide.
I enjoy mainly Machine Learning and Data Science tasks and have been working for the past while in the Graph based Machine Learning space.
Most of my recent work has been in Machine Learning research because I have fundamental questions about the field which have insufficient or non-existent answers.
I hope you enjoy looking through my work :)
